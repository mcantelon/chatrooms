Minimalist multi-room chat application using Express, Socket.io and Jade.

Very basic.

No retention of messages in room.

You want to know who else is in the room?

This will never happen for you.

Installation:

    npm install -g chatrooms

Startup if installed globally:

    chatrooms

Old-school startup:

    ./app.js
